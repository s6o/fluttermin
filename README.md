# Fluttermin

status: WIP

A Single Page Applicaton (SPA) starter for Web, Android and iOS with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
and [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/).

Given a Postgres database the aim of Fluttermin is to get you started writing your
admin panel or dashboard, focusing on the UI with Flutter and taking care of the back-end
API via [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/).
